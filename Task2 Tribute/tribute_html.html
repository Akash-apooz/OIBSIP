  <h4>Missile Man of India</h4>

  <p class="highlight">"You have to dream before your dreams can come true."</p>

  <p>
    Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was not just a name, he was a story of dreams, of hope, of science, and love for the country. Born in a small town Rameswaram in 1931, his life was not easy. But from the very beginning, he had a mind that asked questions and a heart that believed in possibilities.
  </p>

  <p>
    He became a scientist and worked at ISRO and DRDO. He was a big reason behind India’s missile development. The Agni, the Prithvi, those names you hear – he was behind them. That’s why he was called the Missile Man. Not because he built weapons, but because he built confidence in a developing nation.
  </p>

  <p>
    He also became the President of India, from 2002 to 2007. He was loved by students, teachers, and common people. He used to meet students often and answer their questions with a smile. He believed that youth were the future and used every opportunity to inspire them.
  </p>

  <p>
    He wrote books too. <em>Wings of Fire</em> is his autobiography – a must read. He also wrote <em>Ignited Minds</em> and <em>India 2020</em>. His words felt like he was talking to you directly, not as a scientist or president, but like a friend.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even when he got old, he never stopped working. He kept going to schools, colleges, giving speeches. He passed away while doing what he loved – talking to students. That’s how dedicated he was.
  </p>

  <p>
    His life tells us – no matter where you come from, no dream is too big. He made science cool for kids. He showed what a true leader looks like. He will always remain in our hearts.
